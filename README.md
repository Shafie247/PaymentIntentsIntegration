Project:
Custom integration for Stripes PaymentIntents API using Node and React. Overall purpose of the project is to generate a friction report on the documentation provided and the journey of building a custom integration.   

Goals: With this repo you should be able to complete the following steps, 

1. Create a PaymentIntent on the server
2. Collect payment method details on the client
3. Submit the payment to Stripe from the client
4. Asynchronously fulfill the customerâ€™s order



Client side code can be found under app.js

To get it up and running input
//npm install
//npm start 

Once npm is up and running navigate to localhost:3000 

Server side code can be found in the folder server.js
To get it up and running input
//npm install 
//npm run start-backend

To get the frontend to communicate with the server -> run node server.js 

Once you have localhost3000 up and running and it's communicating with the server side code, it's time to run 3 test scenarios: 

1. Integration handles payments that don't require authentication -> Run 4242424242424242 in card details, plus any digits for MM/YY + CVC 
2. Integration handles payments that require authentication -> Run 4000002500003155 in card details, plus any digits for MM/YY + CVC 
3. Your integration handles card declines codes like insufficient funds -> Run 4000000000009995 in card details, plus any digits for MM/YY + CVC 

Additional Notes:

Environment variable used to store both the public and secert key, this can be viewed/updated in .env  

Ensure stripe is installed with -> npm install --save stripe


Webhook: 

To test our webhooks functionality, first install Stripes CLI -> brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe 

Once you make a test payment the custom webhook will store successfull payment information into our payments.txt file 

Hope you have fun playing around!
